# Presentation
As a computer science student at [HEIG-VD](https://heig-vd.ch), I have compiled my entire resume throughout my academic journey. I am happy to share it to assist other students in succeeding in their studies.

# Structure
The folders are organized by semester. S1 represents the first semester of the first year, S3 represents the first semester of the second year, and SE represents the summer semester named `HES d'été`. Inside these folders, you will find all the academic subjects I studied during the respective semester.


**As I was doing the HEIG in part time you will maybe not find the academic subject in the same semester as you!**

<ul><li>- [ ] As I used Notion for the S1 you won't find any documentation about this semester. It's in my ToDo list! </li></ul>   
- [ ] As I used Obsidian for the S2 and S3 you won't find any documentation about this semester. It's in my Todo list!
